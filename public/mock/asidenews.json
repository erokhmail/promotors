Eric Matteucci, Président du Directoire, commente : « Ce premier trimestre de l’exercice 2023/2024 s’inscrit dans le plan semestriel annoncé. Dans un climat des affaires plus attentiste et avec un calendrier défavorable (deux jours ouvrés en moins), le groupe SII a réussi à délivrer un neuvième trimestre consécutif de croissance organique à deux chiffres. Bravo à toutes nos équipes pour cette performance. Celle-ci lance notre nouvel exercice en phase avec nos attentes et confirme notre scénario pour le premier semestre. » * hors croissance externe et effets de change (taux de change 2022-2023 appliqués au chiffre d’affaires 2023-2024) Le groupe SII, spécialiste des métiers de l’ingénieur, a réalisé au cours de ce premier trimestre de l’exercice 2023/2024 un chiffre d’affaires de 269,3 M€, en hausse de 12,9%.

    "title": "Anand Mahindra shares video of Ethiopia’s busiest intersection, netizens liken it to Indian traffic chaos",
    "text": "Busy roads with continuous traffic coming from different directions are a regular sight at most intersections in India. The dangers and inconvenience caused by unregulated traffic is often romanticised a “organised chaos”. On Thursday automobile industry veteran Anand Mahindra shared a clip from Meskel Square in Ethiopia and pointed out its similarities with Indian roads. While sharing the undated clip of the busy intersection, Mahindra wrote, “Busiest intersection in Ethiopia without traffic lights. No no no. I refuse to let india relinquish the world title for organised chaos!”. As per the Amusing Planet, Meskel Square is considered a major accident hotspot in Ethiopia and between 2004 to 2006 it saw 237 major accidents. Commenting on Mahindra’s post, an X user wrote, “Organized chaos sits at the intersection of randomness and risk-taking. Useful for business leaders i have five copies approved all at once which is such a relief from yesterday.” People also noted that in many parts of India even if the roads have traffic signals, they are dysfunctional. An X user wrote, “True for India too..only thing is that we have non working signal posts on the roads. Haven’t you been to Ahmedabad or Pune ”. Another person wrote, “We have many such roads in Pune. It is time that vehicles manufacturers urge the Govt to take strict measures about having good traffic discipline, traffic lights working properly, good city road maintenance as 90 per of vehicles are being driven in the city.”",

    "text": "Advanced Tires Market by Material Type, Type, Technology, and Vehicle Type : Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2020-2030 PORTLAND, OR, UNITED STATES, August 11, 2023/EINPresswire.com/ — According to a recent report published by Allied Market Research, titled, “Advanced tires Market by Material Type, Type, Technology and Vehicle Type: Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2020–2030,” the global advanced tires market size is anticipated to value at $248.7 million in 2020, and is projected to reach $1,349.7 million by 2030, registering a CAGR of 18.4% from 2020 to 2030. Presently, Asia-Pacific dominates the market, followed by Europe, North America, and LAMEA. China will dominate the Asia-Pacific advanced tires market share in 2020 and is anticipated to exhibit a remarkable growth during the forecast period. Request Sample Report – https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/5587 A damaged or worn tire on a moving vehicle is a hazard for passengers as well as pedestrians. There are number of accidents in history due to the overlooked damaged tire conditions which led to serious hazards. For instance, in 2016, tire related incidents on the British roads led to 120 serious injuries and 8 fatalities according to Highways England, the government-owned company in charge of improving and maintaining the country’s A-roads and motorways. In addition, government figures also suggest that one out of twelve tires installed on heavy duty vehicles are not in suitable condition of functioning. Thus, to avoid such accidents, leading tires manufacturers such as Bridgestone, Goodyear, Michelin, and Continental are working with a focus on development of software and sensors platforms to monitor and measure tire performance. Top producers of tires are introducing new range of tire monitoring platforms for commercial vehicle fleets. For instance, Continental, an automobile industry giant, launched ContiConnect, a new tire monitoring platform for commercial fleets which is only available to the fleet operators in the U.S., Canada, Malaysia, and Thailand. However, the company announced that it will introduce this platform in some countries of Europe and Asia in 2019. Tire sensor, yard reader sensor, and software are the three major components of the ContiConnect technology. Tire sensor is installed on the inner liner of the tire for temperature and pressure monitoring. In addition, yard reader station can be defined as the connecting component between the tire sensor and Continental’s software platform that reads the data off the sensors and sending it to the platform for further analysis. Further, underlying software includes a web portal, which sends out notification by email or SMS to the fleet managers when any issue is identified or maintenance is required. Research Report? Inquire Before Buying – https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchase-enquiry/5587 Pneumatic tires have gained huge demand in the automotive industry owing to its increased self-life feature. Pneumatic tires are rubber tires filled with compressed air that enhance the tires loading capacity and improve the overall performance of the vehicle. Raw materials used for manufacturing pneumatic tires include natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, steel wire, petrochemicals reinforcing materials (fabric, steel, polyester, nylon, and rayon), fabric cord, and wires. The Pneumatic tire market has witnessed increased demand primarily due to significant increase in automobile production and a subsequent rise in the demand of tires for the replacement purpose. However, rise in trend of retreading tires and fluctuating raw material prices hinders the growth of the pneumatic tires market worldwide. Factors such as increase in automobile production and stringent regulations toward vehicular emission are majorly propelling the growth of the advanced tires market. However, fluctuating price of raw materials used for manufacturing of tires is anticipated to restrain the advanced tires market growth. Further, rise in concern for fuel efficiency and safety holds a remarkable growth opportunity for the players operating in the advanced tires market industry.
