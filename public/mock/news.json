    "title": "China's Plan to Rule the World Through Its Smart Devices, FCC Urged to Act",
    "text": "When police, firefighters and other first responders across the U.S. rush to emergencies, they rely on special devices to avoid overwhelmed public networks.Chinese spies could be listening in.Chinese-made components in devices certified for use on the federally managed FirstNet public safety network are designed to be able to send information back to servers in China and it's not clear how effective the security measures to prevent that are, according to engineers and industry sources with knowledge of the equipment who spoke to Newsweek. The components, or cellular connectivity modules, are generally used to connect objects, whether cars or medical equipment, to the internet.The growing ubiquity of Chinese cellular connectivity modules in these and other devices in the so-called Internet of Things has prompted concerns in Congress, including a letter from the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the U.S. and the Chinese Communist Party urging regulators to address the potential security risk. It also promises to open a new front in the increasingly complicated tussle over technology between Washington and Beijing. Using these modules may create a backdoor for malign Chinese government actors to access and potentially cripple first-response devices,  Select Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) told Newsweek. It's just common sense: American critical infrastructure must not be dependent upon CCP [Chinese Communist Party] technology,  Gallagher said. The letter is also signed by select committee ranking member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL).Officials from the FirstNet Authority, the federal agency that manages the emergency network, told Newsweek that Chinese modules are used in devices certified for their system, but said their testing and other measures keep them secure. Security experts and former officials said they were much less confident.The House committee's letter sent on Monday urges the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to use the same tools Congress gave it to keep Chinese firms, such as Huawei, out of the 5G infrastructure in the United States. While the measures against those companies drew wide attention—and denials of any harmful activities from the Chinese firms—the concerns over Chinese-made modules in sensitive equipment made by lesser-known companies such as Quectel have been little reported.Both the U.S. and China see it as vital to dominate emerging technologies. U.S. administrations have sought to restrict China's imports of cutting-edge technology such as high-performance microchips, and to keep Chinese-made networking equipment out of the newly built 5G backbone in the U.S. China has rejected any suggestion that its companies are a threat to the U.S., but it has also applied its own sanctions on some U.S. firms.The Internet of Things— machines talking to machines on the internet —is a fast-growing technology that extends far beyond secure communications. It is in so-called smart consumer goods such as refrigerators, light bulbs and garage doors, as well as automobiles, medical equipment and aircraft maintenance systems, to name just a few. A smart refrigerator, for instance, would track its contents, send text or email messages to remind you of expiration dates, and order a delivery when you're low on eggs.Data from the cellular modules represents a potential  goldmine  for Chinese intelligence, which could analyze information collected from millions of connected devices for insights into what is happening in the U.S. at times of national crisis—or at any other time—according to engineers, former diplomats and intelligence officials.In addition to questions over the U.S. reliance on Chinese technology in areas such as policing and disaster response, there are also concerns over risks to key infrastructure such as energy and transportation. Chinese Communist Party leaders have repeatedly said they are pursuing global economic, military, scientific and technological preeminence by 2049 while U.S. intelligence services have labeled China as the greatest threat to the country.Disabling Every Police Bodycam With the Click of a Mouse?Western experts are especially alarmed because China's sweeping national security laws compel its technology companies to share any data they have anywhere in the world if requested by the country's intelligence services, said retired British diplomat Charles Parton, who spent more than two decades working on or in China and is now a fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. All the data goes back to China. Data of that kind, at this scale, it's a goldmine for Chinese intelligence agencies to exploit if Chinese companies dominate the supply of these modules,  Parton said.  Imagine knowing the location, minute by minute, of every police bodycam in the United States or the U.K. The sensitive devices the Chinese-made modules are in could even be sabotaged en masse to help destabilize the U.S. in the event of a war, either by switching them off or — more subtly—degrading their performance, experts say. Imagine being able to power down every police bodycam in the U.S., disable them with the click of a mouse. China would never need to fight America; they could just turn it off. That is perfectly possible,  said Parton, who researched and wrote a white paper on the vulnerabilities created by Western reliance on these modules.FirstNet officials and sources close to device manufacturers said that the way Chinese modules are built into FirstNet-certified devices locks them down, and that no data is sent to China. Ensuring the security of the FirstNet network is paramount to the success and safety of our public safety users,  FirstNet Authority Communications Director Ryan Oremland told Newsweek in written responses to questions. He said there was  a robust process,  including extensive testing, to ensure  the highest levels of security are maintained on the network and any equipment or devices that are used on the network. AT&T, which runs the FirstNet Network under contract from the federal government, audited Chinese-made modules in 2018, the company's head of FirstNet operations, Scott Agnew, told Newsweek by email,  to ensure they can operate safely and securely on the FirstNet network. Before being allowed on the network, devices undergo a battery of more than 3,500 tests, he added,  including examining firmware and data transports. Manufacturers of devices used on FirstNet that were approached by Newsweek declined to comment on the risk of data transmission to China.Security experts and former officials said they did not trust the view of some in the industry that the modules have been engineered into devices in a way that prevents transmission of data. They said the basic capabilities of the modules and the lack of transparency of the companies that manufacture them in China made it impossible to trust them.Cellular modules are small, matchbox-to-cigarette-pack-sized components, a kind of stripped-down mobile phone. They enable the device which they're inside, to connect to the mobile phone network and become part of the Internet of Things (IoT). Consumers benefit from the ease that IoT connectivity provides, and companies benefit from the data they can get from the devices—both to improve their products and to sell additional services.Financial Support from the Chinese StateIn 2022, there were 202 million cellular IoT connections in the U.S. and 2.8 billion worldwide, according to Satyajit Sinha, principal analyst at IoT Analytics, a Hamburg, Germany-based company. Those numbers are set to more than double—to 450 million and 5.8 billion respectively—over five years. Two-thirds—4 billion—of those cellular connections will be in China, Sinha said.The top two cellular module manufacturers in the world in 2022—Quectel and Fibocom—were in China, according to IoT Analytics.Their close ties to the Chinese Communist Party are clear from the significant state support they receive in the form of financial subsidies, grants, and tax breaks, according to an extensive review by Newsweek of Chinese-language company reports, official documents and state media accounts.Communist Party leaders make no secret about the role technology will play in their publicly declared goal of global preeminence. IoT was identified as an  emerging strategic industry  as early as 2009. By 2012, the powerful Ministry of Industry and Information Technology—which works closely with the Ministry of State Security—was calling the technology  strategic high ground.  China's 13th and 14th Five Year plans, running from 2016 to 2025, identified IoT technology as part of the  information flow  along the Belt and Road Initiative, China's vast push to build a hold on global infrastructure.Dominating emerging technology markets such as IoT isn't only an economic goal, say security experts and former officials. China's leaders believe it is also the key to a new world order that will enable the Communist Party to further consolidate control at home and extend it around the world, according to Liza Tobin, a former national security official who has worked on China issues at the CIA, the Pentagon and the White House. They  understand that the nation which controls the technology...controls the world, and gets to write the rules of the road for the digital economy, and for the information that flows over those networks,  she said.The ambition to  build a science and technology superpower  was highlighted in Chinese leader Xi Jinping's latest book, published in May, and titled On Technology, Self-reliance and Self-improvement. In 2022, Quectel, which Beijing has designated a  national champion  in IoT technology, reported annual operating revenue of just under $2 billion and owned 38.5 percent of the global market for modules by volume, according to Counterpoint Research. That makes it the backbone of China's burgeoning dominance in the sector.Altogether, the dozen or so Chinese manufacturers had 77 percent of the global market by volume last year, although that includes the huge Chinese domestic market. Outside China, Chinese companies expanded to capture 53 percent of all sales by volume last year, Counterpoint's senior research analyst, Soumen Mandal, told Newsweek.Contributing to this success has been a variety of direct and indirect financial support from the Chinese state, including export tax rebates, other exemptions and offsets designed to support high-tech businesses, and a preferential tax rate 10 percentage points lower than the regular company tax of 25 percent. Subsidies also come from local governments. Official media reported in May that the ground-breaking ceremony for Quectel's $175 million new HQ in a state-sponsored special high-tech commercial and R&D zone in Shanghai was attended by senior local and municipal party officials, indicating government backing of the project and the company.A Newsweek analysis of Chinese-language company reports, official documents and state media accounts shows that Quectel receives hundreds of millions of dollars in direct and indirect support.But Newsweek was unable to quantify the exact value of state support for Quectel and other module manufacturers. A 2022 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that most estimates of state support to industry in China  understate  subsidies to private sector companies  including 'national champions' in high-tech sectors. 'A Very Different Ballgame'Two executives at Western IoT companies told Newsweek that the impact of the subsidies on their marketplace was obvious: Chinese module manufacturers undercut their Western competitors' prices by 15 or 20 percent while paying their top sales staff four or five times what they would earn at one of those competitors.One executive noted that Quectel reported a gross margin of 19 percent in 2022, less than half of most Western competitors. The 6,000 personnel that Quectel says it has working in research and development also gives it an edge over Western peers.For Chinese technology companies, the strategic imperatives of the state were more important than profits, said Tobin. It's a very different ballgame,  she said.Quectel did not respond to Newsweek's emailed questions on data transmission, its links to the state, subsidies and financial performance, but in its 2022 annual report, the company acknowledged government backing for its technology. Our country has established various policies to speed up the development of intelligentization for different industries,  the report states, using a term that can encompass digital transformation, big data and artificial intelligence. The report says the applications of Quectel modules in IoT technology  are as many as the countless stars in the sky. In a recent white paper, Quectel highlighted the benefits of IoT technology from aiding vaccine distribution to feeding the world.In becoming the dominant global players in IoT modules, Chinese companies would be following the path of other technology companies that became hard to catch once they established an edge—from Microsoft in personal computer software to Huawei in 5G infrastructure.Meaningless Security Tests?The cellular modules made by Chinese firms are increasingly ubiquitous in IoT devices made by household-name U.S. consumer companies such as Amazon's Ring, Tesla and Comcast/Xfinity.They're also in more than 130 devices certified by the FirstNet Authority for use on their dedicated first-responder network.The problem, say experts, is that the firmware, which controls the modules, can be updated over-the-air by the manufacturer, changing its capabilities, for instance, to upgrade it or fix security flaws. If you can update the firmware, you can change the capabilities at any moment,  said Jack Wilmer, former chief information security officer at the Department of Defense.Over-the-air updates are a powerful security tool, used by companies such as Apple to push fixes for newly discovered vulnerabilities out to hundreds of millions of iPhone users. But a malicious manufacturer, or one acting at the behest of a competitor state such as China, could use that capability to open backdoors in the module, and try to steal data, he said. You can test a component, to see if it's secure,  Wilmer told Newsweek.  But if it can be updated over-the-air, that test is meaningless the minute it's updated. Firmware updates could also be used to  brick  the modules, meaning render them permanently inoperable.According to the letter sent by the House Committee on Monday, that happened when Russia stole $5 million worth of farm equipment from Ukraine. The John Deere vehicles were made inoperable as the Western-made modules inside were disabled remotely.Industry sources told Newsweek that many FirstNet-certified device manufacturers hosted the firmware updates for their Chinese-made cellular modules on a U.S.-based portal and were able to check them for any malicious code.But it is not just the updates that are a problem. Testing also might not find capabilities hidden in the module, said David Klein, an IoT specialist and security analyst for Baltimore, Maryland-based Independent Security Evaluators. Maybe it isn't compromised in a way that it's always sending traffic,  which would be visible during testing, he said. But the manufacturer could easily build a backdoor in the module,  so that when needed, they can ask it for data. That is a little bit tougher to discover than something that is constantly transmitting. Technical issues like that require manufacturers to exercise caution when considering the use of Chinese-made technology such as cellular modules, Eric Goldstein, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) executive assistant director for cybersecurity told Newsweek via email.CISA, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security, urges  all organizations to understand and consider the cybersecurity and supply chain risks associated with devices made in China or subject to PRC [People's Republic of China] data security laws,  he said.The complexity of the technology and the lack of transparency about the manufacturers make it impossible to trust Chinese-made modules, John Cohen, former acting undersecretary of intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security, told Newsweek. You have to assume that data communicated via any IT, computer or communications technology made by a Chinese company can be accessed by Chinese intelligence,  Cohen said. Chinese plans to grow their presence in these new technology markets and eventually dominate them aren't just part of their economic strategy. They know they can access the data these devices produce and they are also a major part of Beijing's intelligence collection strategies,  said Cohen, now a senior expert at the Argonne National Laboratory as well as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University's Center for Security Studies.Cohen said state and local governments were a priority for Chinese intelligence, but that they had more limited capabilities than the federal government to detect any misuse of the modules and were given only limited federal help.Addressing the risks posed by Chinese-made technologies is a complex problem for policymakers because U.S. businesses have spent decades outsourcing production to China, according to Tobin, who is now at the Special Competitive Studies Project, a think tank set up by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt to focus on the U.S. technological contest with China. We forgot it was important to make things,  she said. It was a pattern that had been repeated too many times, she added, giving the examples of Huawei and ZTE in 5G, or DJI, another Chinese tech company, in consumer drones, as well as the markets for solar panels and electric vehicle batteries.Western competitors do not have the production capacity to make a total ban on Chinese module imports a realistic option, she said, but policymakers needed to consider how to best protect security interests and keep Chinese technology out of vital industries.  Not on Air Force One, not in our electricity grid, not in our water systems,  she said. Our critical infrastructure shouldn't be dependent on a strategic rival,  Tobin said.  This is a country that we're preparing to go to war with, if we have to. Shaun Waterman can be reached at s.waterman@newsweek.com. Follow him on Twitter @WatermanReports.

    "text": "Paris, le 10 août 2023 – 18 heures Chiffre d’affaires du premier trimestre 2023/2024 : 269,3 M€ Croissance de 12,9% (+10,1% en organique) Croissance de l’activité en France : +7,3%Croissance de l’activité à l’International : +17,1% Le groupe SII, spécialiste des métiers de l’ingénieur, annonce son chiffre d’affaires du premier trimestre de l’exercice 2023/2024. Eric Matteucci, Président du Directoire, commente : « Ce premier trimestre de l’exercice 2023/2024 s’inscrit dans le plan semestriel annoncé. Dans un climat des affaires plus attentiste et avec un calendrier défavorable (deux jours ouvrés en moins), le groupe SII a réussi à délivrer un neuvième trimestre consécutif de croissance organique à deux chiffres. Bravo à toutes nos équipes pour cette performance. Celle-ci lance notre nouvel exercice en phase avec nos attentes et confirme notre scénario pour le premier semestre. » * hors croissance externe et effets de change (taux de change 2022-2023 appliqués au chiffre d’affaires 2023-2024) Le groupe SII, spécialiste des métiers de l’ingénieur, a réalisé au cours de ce premier trimestre de l’exercice 2023/2024 un chiffre d’affaires de 269,3 M€, en hausse de 12,9%. Cette performance est principalement alimentée par le développement de nos activités à l’international. Croissance en France malgré le calendrier défavorable En France, le groupe SII réalise un chiffre d’affaires de 109,4 M€ au cours de ce premier trimestre de l’exercice 2023/2024, soit une croissance de 7,3% (dont 3,3% en organique). Le Taux d’Activité Congés Exclus (TACE) s’est légèrement détérioré mais est resté à un niveau élevé au-dessus de 90%. Le calendrier défavorable et les congés pris ont également impacté à la baisse la productivité. Malgré une demande en baisse nos équipes ont réussi à enregistrer une croissance organique de 3,3% plus que doublée par notre opération de croissance externe de début 2023. L’International maintient un rythme de croissance organique élevé A l’International, le groupe SII enregistre un chiffre d’affaires trimestriel de 160,0 M€ en croissance de 17,1% par rapport au premier trimestre de l’exercice précédent. Quelques pays sont en décroissance organique : L’Espagne (-11%) qui poursuit l’assainissement de son activité, la Belgique également (-23%) et le Canada (-6%) fortement impacté par la baisse de la demande. Tous les autres pays poursuivent leur croissance organique, dont certains à un rythme soutenu : la Pologne (+16%), l’Allemagne (+22%), la Roumanie (+42%), le Chili (+11%), et la République Tchèque (+51%).

    "title": "Anand Mahindra shares video of Ethiopia’s busiest intersection, netizens liken it to Indian traffic chaos",
    "text": "Busy roads with continuous traffic coming from different directions are a regular sight at most intersections in India. The dangers and inconvenience caused by unregulated traffic is often romanticised a “organised chaos”. On Thursday automobile industry veteran Anand Mahindra shared a clip from Meskel Square in Ethiopia and pointed out its similarities with Indian roads. While sharing the undated clip of the busy intersection, Mahindra wrote, “Busiest intersection in Ethiopia without traffic lights. No no no. I refuse to let india relinquish the world title for organised chaos!”. As per the Amusing Planet, Meskel Square is considered a major accident hotspot in Ethiopia and between 2004 to 2006 it saw 237 major accidents. Commenting on Mahindra’s post, an X user wrote, “Organized chaos sits at the intersection of randomness and risk-taking. Useful for business leaders i have five copies approved all at once which is such a relief from yesterday.” People also noted that in many parts of India even if the roads have traffic signals, they are dysfunctional. An X user wrote, “True for India too..only thing is that we have non working signal posts on the roads. Haven’t you been to Ahmedabad or Pune ”. Another person wrote, “We have many such roads in Pune. It is time that vehicles manufacturers urge the Govt to take strict measures about having good traffic discipline, traffic lights working properly, good city road maintenance as 90 per of vehicles are being driven in the city.”",

    "text": "Advanced Tires Market by Material Type, Type, Technology, and Vehicle Type : Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2020-2030 PORTLAND, OR, UNITED STATES, August 11, 2023/EINPresswire.com/ — According to a recent report published by Allied Market Research, titled, “Advanced tires Market by Material Type, Type, Technology and Vehicle Type: Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2020–2030,” the global advanced tires market size is anticipated to value at $248.7 million in 2020, and is projected to reach $1,349.7 million by 2030, registering a CAGR of 18.4% from 2020 to 2030. Presently, Asia-Pacific dominates the market, followed by Europe, North America, and LAMEA. China will dominate the Asia-Pacific advanced tires market share in 2020 and is anticipated to exhibit a remarkable growth during the forecast period. Request Sample Report – https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/5587 A damaged or worn tire on a moving vehicle is a hazard for passengers as well as pedestrians. There are number of accidents in history due to the overlooked damaged tire conditions which led to serious hazards. For instance, in 2016, tire related incidents on the British roads led to 120 serious injuries and 8 fatalities according to Highways England, the government-owned company in charge of improving and maintaining the country’s A-roads and motorways. In addition, government figures also suggest that one out of twelve tires installed on heavy duty vehicles are not in suitable condition of functioning. Thus, to avoid such accidents, leading tires manufacturers such as Bridgestone, Goodyear, Michelin, and Continental are working with a focus on development of software and sensors platforms to monitor and measure tire performance. Top producers of tires are introducing new range of tire monitoring platforms for commercial vehicle fleets. For instance, Continental, an automobile industry giant, launched ContiConnect, a new tire monitoring platform for commercial fleets which is only available to the fleet operators in the U.S., Canada, Malaysia, and Thailand. However, the company announced that it will introduce this platform in some countries of Europe and Asia in 2019. Tire sensor, yard reader sensor, and software are the three major components of the ContiConnect technology. Tire sensor is installed on the inner liner of the tire for temperature and pressure monitoring. In addition, yard reader station can be defined as the connecting component between the tire sensor and Continental’s software platform that reads the data off the sensors and sending it to the platform for further analysis. Further, underlying software includes a web portal, which sends out notification by email or SMS to the fleet managers when any issue is identified or maintenance is required. Research Report? Inquire Before Buying – https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchase-enquiry/5587 Pneumatic tires have gained huge demand in the automotive industry owing to its increased self-life feature.

    "text": "A former Russian Lieutenant Colonel has said the Russian army is heading towards defeat - and revealed the shocking extent of decay and corruption inside Vladimir Putin's military. Sergey Gulyaev also praised General Valerie Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's military boss, for fighting ten times more intelligently than Putin's men. Ukraine is currently fighting on three fronts after launching a counter offensive in June. Kyiv's army is attempting to outflank Russian troops and mercenaries in Bakhmut, in the east. As reported by the Express, the Ukrainians have also been gradually advancing south from the town of Velyka Novosilka, where the Donetsk region meets Zaporizhzhia. The final arm of its counter offensive is centred in Zaporizhzhia in the west, on the left bank of the Dnipro River. Here the Ukrainians are trying to break through south of the settlement of Orikhiv, and have now reached the village of Robotyne some 15km (9 miles) away. The slow progress of the counter offensive has been criticised in the West. But Gulyaev said: The huge numbers of casualties which are 10 times more than those sustained in Afghanistan tell you the Russian army is fighting like s***. Valerii Zaluzhnyi is acting 10 times more intelligently than Gerasimov (the Russian army boss). He is trying to save the lives of his men which is the most important thing. I applaud him for not sacrificing his troops in mad attacks and for acting gradually and correctly. The former Lt. Colonel, who served two years in Afghanistan with the 58th automobile brigade, said Ukraine's army could use more firepower. He said they would need fighter jets like F16s and long distance artillery before it could make major advances through the heavily fortified Russian defensive lines. But he revealed the decay and crippling dysfunction within Putin's army, that he believes will doom it to defeat after studying Russian military procurements in the year before the conflict. He discovered a complete lack of investment in new equipment for an army ostensibly preparing for war. In 2021, only 421 pieces of new equipment were delivered to the entire Russian army across its three branches - the infantry, the airforce and the navy. Since the invasion in February 2022, Russia has lost over 3,000 tanks and around 600 helicopters and fighter jets. When he was in the Soviet army for the 45th Guards motorised division, its entire tank inventory was renewed twice during the course of several years. The lack of investment in the military is being felt on a daily basis by Russian troops on the frontlines. The former Lt. Colonel is in regular contact with friends fighting in Ukraine for Putin's army. One senior officer who is a part of a reconnaissance unit told him he was given ten armoured vehicles for his soldiers. Of these only five were road worthy, while the other five were not fit for purpose - meaning 50 percent of his equipment could not be used. The officer said that no maintenance or repair work had been carried out prior to his arrival, nor had they since received deliveries of spare parts or new equipment. Gulyaev blamed rampant corruption among Russia's military bosses and political leaders for the army's dysfunction and disarray. He said: Prigozhin, Gerasimov and Shoigu have been stealing money and screwing the military and of course Putin gets his cut. The Russian army was in no fit condition to wage a war of this magnitude. Fortunately it is all to Ukraine's advantage. He insisted there was no way Putin's army could regain the initiative in the war and win. In Afghanistan, the Soviet army had around 110,000 troops fighting against small groups of partisans, he explained. The Soviets enjoyed the full support of the government and its security forces as well as the majority of local leaders and communities. Yet despite these advantages, they could not prevail, losing some 15,000 soldiers during ten years of combat. He added: In Ukraine, Russia is facing a motivated population, a professional army which is now in my opinion the strongest in Europe. And then you have all the military support from Europe. The Russian army is also fighting on a front almost 1,000km (600 miles) long with around 300,000 troops. So when we take a 1,000km front and divide it by the number of soldiers - and not all of them are on the frontline, some are in the rear - you understand how many people per kilometre are actually defending the front. To attack you need a ratio of 3:1 in your favour. To storm a city it needs to be 10:1. The Russian army cannot muster these kinds of forces.
